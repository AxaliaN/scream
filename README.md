# scream
Small Go project for fun times.

## Building

`go build -o scream main.go`

## Usage

- `scream text you want to scream`, e.g.: `scream help` outputs `:alphabet-white-h::alphabet-white-e::alphabet-white-l::alphabet-white-p:  :alphabet-white-m::alphabet-white-e:`
- You could be like me and make a symlink to `/usr/bin/scream` by doing `ln -s ./scream /usr/bin/scream`
